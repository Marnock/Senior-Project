SENIOR PROJECT LAYOUT

1. All code I developed is found in 'Project Immix/CODE/Finished For Senior Project'. Code found in 'Project Immix/CODE/In Development' contains features that I am currently working on and didnt finish for the presentation.

2. 'Project Immix/Immix Kit' contains all non-script things. 'Immix/Immix Kit/Game Data' contains the files that are created from the scripts and is where values and behaviors are changed.

3. 'Assets' contains the packages I used for the environment and player models. These are not my own and I did not use a vast majority of them.
